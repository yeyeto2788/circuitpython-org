+all.
+

 * Using welcoming and inclusive language
 * Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences
+* Collaborating with other community members

+
+The goal of the standards and moderation guidelines outlined here is to build
+and maintain a respectful community. We ask that you don’t just aim to be
+"technically unimpeachable", but rather try to be your best self. 
+
+We value many things beyond technical expertise, including collaboration and
+supporting others within our community. Providing a positive experience for
+other community members can have a much more significant impact than simply
+providing the correct answer.

+Project leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or

-permanently any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate,
-threatening, offensive, or harmful.
+permanently any community member for other behaviors that they deem
+inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.
 
-## Scope
+## Moderation
 
-This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
-when an individual is representing the project or its community. Examples of
-representing a project or community include using an official project e-mail
-address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed
-representative at an online or offline event. Representation of a project may be
-further defined and clarified by project maintainers.
+Instances of behaviors that violate the Adafruit Community Code of Conduct
+may be reported by any member of the community. Community members are
+encouraged to report these situations, including situations they witness
+involving other community members.
+
+You may report in the following ways:
+
+In any situation, you may send an email to <support@adafruit.com>.
 
-## Enforcement
+On the Adafruit Discord, you may send an open message from any channel
+to all Community Helpers by tagging @community helpers. You may also send an
+open message from any channel, or a direct message to @kattni#1507,
+@tannewt#4653, @Dan Halbert#1614, @cater#2442, @sommersoft#0222, or
+@Andon#8175.
 
-Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be
-reported by contacting the project team at support@adafruit.com. All
-complaints will be reviewed and investigated and will result in a response that
-is deemed necessary and appropriate to the circumstances. The project team is
-obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
-Further details of specific enforcement policies may be posted separately.
+Email and direct message reports will be kept confidential.
 
-Project maintainers who do not follow or enforce the Code of Conduct in good
-faith may face temporary or permanent repercussions as determined by other
-members of the project's leadership.
+In situations on Discord where the issue is particularly egregious, possibly
+illegal, requires immediate action, or violates the Discord terms of service,
+you should also report the message directly to Discord.
+
+These are the steps for upholding our community’s standards of conduct.
+
+1. Any member of the community may report any situation that violates the
+Adafruit Community Code of Conduct. All reports will be reviewed and
+investigated.
+2. If the behavior is an egregious violation, the community member who
+committed the violation may be banned immediately, without warning.
+3. Otherwise, moderators will first respond to such behavior with a warning.
+4. Moderators follow a soft "three strikes" policy - the community member may
+be given another chance, if they are receptive to the warning and change their
+behavior.
+5. If the community member is unreceptive or unreasonable when warned by a
+moderator, or the warning goes unheeded, they may be banned for a first or
+second offense. Repeated offenses will result in the community member being
+banned.
+
+## Scope
+
+This Code of Conduct and the enforcement policies listed above apply to all
+Adafruit Community venues. This includes but is not limited to any community
+spaces (both public and private), the entire Adafruit Discord server, and
+Adafruit GitHub repositories. Examples of Adafruit Community spaces include
+but are not limited to meet-ups, audio chats on the Adafruit Discord, or
+interaction at a conference.
+
+This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces
+when an individual is representing the project or its community. As a community
+member, you are representing our community, and are expected to behave
+accordingly.
